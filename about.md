## Ahoy, glad you made it here!

I'm Stefan Exner (hence the domain name), currently working as Digital Solution Architect and living in Hamburg, Germany.

I've always been interested in everything regarding computers and started with programming when I was around 11. Ruby was the first programming language I really fell in love with in 2008 due to its code just feeling... elegant - and I still love it. Of course it's important to always choose the right tool for each job, but when I can use Ruby, there's a high chance I will :)

Apart from development, I love making music (Piano, Guitar, Violin, Singing), Audiobooks ("HÃ¶rspiele") and amateur VA work.

### Experience

#### "DevOps"

This is such a buzzword that can mean almost everything... for me, it's more or less being an engineer with both programming and administration/deployment knowledge. I like to write code, deploy it and make sure it runs fine in production instead of just tossing the finished code over to whomever and forgetting about it.

While I'm definitely not an export in server administration, I usually get where I need to with a bit of help from Google. I love working with Docker due to its encapsulation, scalability and the general feeling of creating something tidy. With `docker-compose`/`docker stack`, even complex microservice architectures became managable again.

Example work: This website runs in Docker behind [`nginx-proxy`](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy) on an own vServer, each push triggers a build through Github Actions and deployment is done via webhook.
